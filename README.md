# POKEMON DATA ANALYSIS WITH PANDAS 
This project is a beginner-friendly data analysis notebook built using Python and Pandas. It explores a dataset of PokÃ©mon, 
demonstrating key data handling and transformation techniques such as filtering, sorting, grouping, and visualization. 
    
## Project Overview 
Analyzes the PokÃ©mon dataset using `pandas` and `numpy`. 
Performs data cleaning, filtering, and grouping operations. 
Includes sorting by attributes like `HP`, `Attack`, and `Legendary` status. 
Demonstrates logical conditions and advanced filtering (e.g., PokÃ©mon that are both `Fire` and `Flying` type). 
Aims to give a strong foundational understanding of data analysis in Python. 
Technologies Used - Python 3.x   - Pandas   - NumPy   - Jupyter Notebook 

## Dataset 
The dataset used is `pokemon_data.csv`, which contains the following columns: - Name - Type 1 - Type 2 - HP - Attack - Defense - Speed - Generation - Legendary 
> Note: You must have the CSV file in the same directory as the notebook to run it successfully.
